<p class="post-content">
Occasionally, I read research papers. Topics aren't usually decided, so I read either due to its interesting title or because of my interest. So far, I haven't read many papers, but I'm trying to build this habit where I'll put some effort to read and understand at least one paper in a month. 
<br>
<br>
Numbers aren't a huge factor here. Sometimes, it takes months to read a paper, and sometimes it takes weeks. I'm interested in better content for the sake of knowledge and information. I hope I get to build this habit and stick to it for a while.
