I usually have to sit before my computer for long hours. Since I use an extra monitor, I can't be on the bed with my laptop. It isn't an issue, but I think I've put myself in a tough situation where I face a remarkably hard time working only on the laptop. I'm just hoping that this habit won't cause issues for me in the future.

At around 11 pm, I finally start working/studying. I don't sleep during the night, don't even remember the last time I slept before 11 pm. Although I enjoy working late at night, I think this is another bad habit I've learned which is going to give me a hard time.

Talking about bad habits, I think I've got another one. Maybe it's not a bad habit, but I think it's a downside because I need music for the whole time I'm looking at the screen. Sometimes, I get so distracted when I'm not able to find good music. The playlists I've got - I've listened to all the songs so many times that I'm I can't help myself, so I end up skipping them all the time, but I also need good songs. I know this sounds childish, but I don't know what to do. It drives me crazy sometimes. YouTube's suggestion algorithm doesn't always help, but it does its job. On the other hand, people I know are useless when it comes to recommending music. Anyway, I can't rely on people for music recommendations, and it's mostly due to the difference in the taste of music.

It's almost 8 am, and I'm listening to Holding On by Pascal Junior. It's a random song that YouTube offered me just a few minutes ago.  The [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-ozc6Ip2wM&list=RDFnywjbkPsOA&index=8) based on the suggestion has good songs.
