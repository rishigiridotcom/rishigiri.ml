Got the following __warning__ while updating `udev` on my machine. I use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

```
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_guc_ver9_14.bin for module i915
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/bxt_guc_ver8_7.bin for module i915
```

__STEP 1__

Check if the firmware (package) exists in the provided directory or not. This step isn't required, but anyway -


```sh
$ cd /lib/firmware/i915

$ ls | grep kbl_guc
```

__STEP 2__

- Search for all the missing firmware from [here](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/i915/bxt_guc_33.0.0.bin).

- Click on __plain__ to download the blob of each firmware. It's going to be something like this - 

```
blob: e42b8c5412c09a59ab7fe16861275bbb0f20e54c (plain)
```

__STEP 3__

Let's suppose you saved the files on Desktop. Now - 

```sh
$ cd Desktop

$ sudo mv *.bin /lib/firmware/i915/
``` 

__STEP 4__

The firmware warning appeared after `update-initramfs: deferring update (trigger activated)` while `Generating /boot/initrd.img-4.15.0-76-generic`, which means the firmware (module) depends upon `update-initramfs`. So, let's update it, and reboot - 

```sh
$ sudo update-initramfs -u

$ reboot
```

__That's it__. This should fix the warnings.
