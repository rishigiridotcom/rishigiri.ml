A few days back, I was listening to [Can I Call You Tonight?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh1WeQxfCX0) by DayGlow. It's a beautiful and entertaining song. The best thing about this song is the video. Too damn creative.

I liked it so much that I decided to share the song with someone I know, but I didn’t. It made me think - why I wanted to share it, and why I didn’t? There’s a chain of processes involved, so what’s the mental model behind this?

It isn’t a complete blog post as I’m still reading different kinds of blog/articles and research papers to understand the human psychology so that I can puzzle out the process behind __why do we share songs__, I’m also trying to perceive Human Psychology, in general.

I'll put things here in chunks and pieces, so let's see how it goes.
