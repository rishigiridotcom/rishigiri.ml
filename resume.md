<p> I'm not proud of what I've done so far, but here are the few things that have been a part of my life - </p>

<p><strong>1. Freelancing </strong> : Four years of irregular freelancing. Built Web Apps, Command Line Tools, APIs, Chrome Extensions, Scrappers, and Websites.</p>

<p><strong>2. Teaching </strong> : Taught Computer Science to the students of class 11th and 12th for six months at Don Bosco Sr Sec School.</p>

<p><strong>3. Engineering </strong> : Joined a startup called Gorakhmart, where I built and shipped the complete product (e-commerce based) from scratch. Later, I worked on the company’s cab platform where my work was primarily related to the product’s performance. Probably worked for around nine months or so. </p>

<p><strong>4. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghost%20Programmer">Ghost Programmer</a> </strong> : A weird phase of life when I didn't care about anything. Used to work on behalf of people. Did the work for a tiny amount of money. At that time, money didn't matter to me. I was passionate about building things, so I did it for nothing.</p>

<p><strong>5. Blogging </strong> : Have done a lot of blogging. This was during the initial days (around 2016-2017). None of the blog exists. Mainly worked as a web designer/developer and content writer. It was fun! </p>

<p><strong>6. Designing </strong> : Back in the days, I used to do graphic designing, mostly logos and wallpapers. Made some money out of it, but didn't do it for long. For a really small period, I worked as a graphic designer for this Custom Linux based OS Project called Oikyo Linux. </p>
