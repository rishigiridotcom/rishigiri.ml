If I don't write anything down, I face problems committing to it. I don't remember since when this started to happen, but I feel like I've commitment issues.

Once in a while, I feel very anxious being on social media. It happens every year, or probably every month. Most of the time, I get over of this feeling, but sometimes the force is sharp, and it makes my mind fill up with hundreds and thousands of thoughts and questions.

It is not the last time I'm writing about taking a break from social media, but I have no idea what else to do.  As I've said, if I won't write, I won't do. This post will act as a reminder for me so that I can prevent myself from uselessly checking Instagram and Twitter. I won't even bother checking Instagram.

Twitter is my source of news and other updates, so instead of completely giving up on it, I'll limit its usage, as well. It's going to be a little hard, but it feels like it's eating way too much of my time.

A couple of hours back, I was listening to [Naval, on Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44), and now when I'm writing this post, one thing that's coming to my mind is ["Social Contract"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract). Naval was talking about how powerful it is.

*"If you're serious about something, you announce it on Facebook. You'' tell your wife. You'll tell your friends."*

To under this term in a better way, I checked Wikipedia. Although, it has a little different definition than what I expected it to be, but the context is understandable.

> In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.

I'm genuinely serious about giving up on Instagram and limit the use of twitter to minimum. Due to continous complanining and furstration, I quit using Facebook approximately eight months back, and I think the same thing will happen with Instagram, as well. It will take some time, but I'll get there.

I'm extremely serious about giving up on Instagram for a lengthier period and limit the use of twitter to a minimum. Due to continuous complaining and frustration, I quit using Facebook approximately eight months back, and I think the same thing will happen with Instagram, as well. It will take some time, but I'll get there.

I don't hate or dislike any social media platform. I merely want to utilize my time.
