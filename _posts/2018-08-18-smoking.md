Estimated number of days I spent smoking, continuously. Everything I'm going to write here is based on a rough assumption. So, let's begin.

I will assume that I've been smoking for 2.5 years. Now -

- 2.5 years = 30 months.

- 30 months = 912 days.


I will also assume that each day, I smoked at least 3 cigarettes. So -

1 day = 3 cigarettes.

912 days = 2736 cigarettes.

Now, let's assume that it takes at least 5 minutes to smoke one cigarette.

- 1 cigarette = 5 minutes.

- 2736 cigarette = 13680 minutes.

Alright, now -

- 60 minutes = 1 hour.

- 13680 minutes = 228 hours.

And finally -

- 24 hours = 1 day.

- So, 228 hours = 9.5 days.

Wait, there is more. Those 9.5 days are solely dedicated to smoking, it means I didn't eat, sleep, or did anything other than smoking cigarettes, and neither I consumed a single second to lit the cigarette, but that's not possible, right?

Let's add another thing. Suppose, it takes around ~5 seconds to lit the cigarette, and I smoked 2736 cigarettes.

1 cigarette = 5 seconds.

2736 cigarettes = 13680 seconds.

13680 seconds = 3.8 hours.

And, 3.8 hours = 0.158 days.

Now, summing up everything, we get -

9.5 days + 0.158333 days = 9.658 days.

It means I spent 9.658 days (228 hours + 3.8 hours) doing nothing other than smoking and lighting cigarettes.

Another thing which is not hypothetical but could be interesting -

Taking 912 days as a base, 2188.8 cigarettes were smoked in 182.4 days, and 547.2 cigarettes were smoked in 729.6 days.
