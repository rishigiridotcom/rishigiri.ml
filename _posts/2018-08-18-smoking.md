__Estimated number of days I spent smoking, continuously.__ Everything I'm going to write here is based on a rough assumption. So, let's begin.

I will assume that I've been smoking for __2.5 years__. Now -


- 2.5 years = 30 months.

- __30 months = 912 days.__


I will also assume that each day, I smoked at least __3 cigarettes__. So -

- 1 day = 3 cigarettes.

- __912 days = 2736 cigarettes.__

Now, let's assume that it takes at least __5 minutes__ to smoke one cigarette.

- 1 cigarette = 5 minutes.

- __2736 cigarette = 13680 minutes__.

Alright, now -

- 60 minutes = 1 hour.

- __13680 minutes = 228 hours.__

And finally -

- 24 hours = 1 day.

- __So, 228 hours = 9.5 days.__

Wait, there is more. Those __9.5 days__ are solely dedicated to smoking, it means __I didn't eat, sleep, or did anything other than smoking cigarettes, and neither I consumed a single second to lit the cigarette__, but that's not possible, right?

Let's add another thing. Suppose, it takes around __~5 seconds__ to lit the cigarette, and I smoked __2736 cigarettes.__

- 1 cigarette = 5 seconds.

- 2736 cigarettes = 13680 seconds.

- __13680 seconds = 3.8 hours.__

- And, __3.8 hours = 0.158 days.__

Now, summing up everything, we get -

> 9.5 days + 0.158333 days = 9.658 days.

It means I spent __9.658 days__ *(228 hours + 3.8 hours)* doing nothing other than smoking and lighting cigarettes.

Another thing which is not hypothetical but could be interesting -

> Taking 912 days as a base, 2188.8 cigarettes were smoked in 182.4 days, and 547.2 cigarettes were smoked in 729.6 days.
