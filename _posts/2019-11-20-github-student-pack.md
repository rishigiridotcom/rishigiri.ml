After procrastinating for a week, I'm finally applying for GitHub's Student Developer Pack. It took almost a week for me to answer a simple question.

> How do you plan to use GitHub?

It's a simple question, and I know how do I plan to use GitHub, but for some reasons, I wasn't able to craft my words, the way I wanted to. Every day, I opened my text editor, wrote a bunch of sentences, and closed it down.

It wasn't hard for me to write the answer, but I procrastinated, and now I know how does it feel to do something in a week when in reality, you can complete the same thing in around 30 minutes or so.

It took around 10 minutes to write, and the next 20 minutes were spent thinking if what I've written makes sense or not.

__Here's what I wrote and sent -__

> I've been using GitHub for a while now. I still remember when I created my account but had absolutely no idea of anything that was happening. I indeed wiped out my  ~/home with `git rm` because I was having a hard time understanding Git and GitHub. <br><br>
It took me some time, but I understood what's the work and purpose of GitHub, and how important it is for people like me. If it wasn't GitHub, I might not have been aware of Programming and Open Source. I love to code, and I genuinely care about FOSS.<br><br>
GitHub Student Developer is important to me. I'm focused on developing better things than what I've built in the past. As a student, I don't get much time to do a lot of things, so it's not entirely possible for me to pay for the features that GitHub is providing to the students.<br><br>
The initial goal is to make progress towards becoming a better developer while contributing to the Open Source as much as I can. So, here's how I'm planning to use GitHub's Student Developer Pack - <br><br>
1) Use Bootstrap Studio, Canva, Iconscout, Icons8, Weglot to learn and build user interfaces and improve my fronted skills. <br><br>
2) Use Datadog, AWS, Azure, mnx.io to learn, understand, and experiment with the cloud. <br><br>
3) Use Flatiron School, Thinkful, Covalence, Go Rails, next.tech, Interview Cake, One Month, Frontend Masters, Educative to improve my skills as a programmer.
Most importantly, I want to build sensible projects, write tutorials, and make useful contributions to open source. <br><br>
I can go on and on, but I think these are some basic ways of how I'm planning to use GitHub.

That's it. I think it makes sense, I guess. Although I don't know if other people provide such a brief answer while applying, for me, it was different, so I wrote what was going on top of my mind.

I just got the email from GitHub, and I'm very happy. I don't have much to say. I'll just check everything, and then I'll probably get some sleep.
