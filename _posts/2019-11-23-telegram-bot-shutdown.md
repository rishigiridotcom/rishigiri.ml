I dislike a lot of people who are in my contact list. There is nothing personal about anything, but it makes me feel extremely anxious when I spot them being a hypocrite. This happens a lot, so I decided to build a simple Telegram bot which can send reminders to these people on a daily basis. Of course, I gave them option to unsubscribe. I didn't wanted to harass them with my messages. I did it for fun. That's it.

Here are the messages -

```js
{
  "wisdom" : [
        {"message" : "Lose it all and hit yourself in the head with a hammer to make the voices stop."},
        {"message" : "One day, life will lose meaning. Until then, keep working in an office building."},
        {"message" : "Why do your best when you can just kill yourself? "}
        {"message" : "Someone has to be a pathetic piece of shit. You can do it."}
        {"message" : "The fact that you are sexy, doesn't mean that you are talented."}
        {"message" : "Marriage is just another word for a nuclear test site."}
        {"message" : "You are a lonely normie."}
        {"message" : "Someone should feel pain. You can be that someone."}
        {"message" : "Let people know that your life is incredibly loaded with diseases."}
  ]
}
```

__Thanks to the lovely [Inspirbot](https://www.reddit.com/r/inspirobot/) for all the quotes!__

The subscribe again, the user needs to message - <strong><kbd>`/iamafuckfacehypocrite`</kbd></strong>

To be honest, I'm going to shut it down. It's been two days and two messages must have already been sent, and I think that's enough. I enjoyed this short-termed happiness. Sometimes I do childish things, but I think it's okay.

On a lighter note, I just found out that we can [schedule messages on Telegram](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/09/telegram-adds-message-scheduling). Not bad!
