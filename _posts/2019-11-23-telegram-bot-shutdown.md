I dislike a lot of people who are in my contact list. There is nothing personal about anything, but it makes me feel extremely anxious when I spot them being a hypocrite. It happens a lot, so I decided to build a simple Telegram bot which can send reminders to these people, daily. Of course, I gave them the option to unsubscribe. I didn’t want to harass them with my messages. I did it for fun. That’s it.

Here are the messages -

```js
{
  "wisdom" : [
        {"message" : "Lose it all and hit yourself in the head with a hammer to make the voices stop."},
        {"message" : "One day, life will lose meaning. Until then, keep working in an office building."},
        {"message" : "Why do your best when you can just kill yourself? "}
        {"message" : "Someone has to be a pathetic piece of shit. You can do it."}
        {"message" : "The fact that you are sexy, doesn't mean that you are talented."}
        {"message" : "Marriage is just another word for a nuclear test site."}
        {"message" : "You are a lonely normie."}
        {"message" : "Someone should feel pain. You can be that someone."}
        {"message" : "Let people know that your life is incredibly loaded with diseases."}
  ]
}
```

__Thanks to the lovely [Inspirbot](https://www.reddit.com/r/inspirobot/) for all the quotes!__

The messages are getting sent in the following format -

I'm going to shut the bot down. It's been a couple of days, and the people in my contact list must have already received some messages, and I think that's enough. I know it was a dick move, but I enjoyed doing it. No hard feelings for anyone, it's just that those people are remarkably irritating.

On a lighter note, I just found out that we can [schedule messages on Telegram](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/09/telegram-adds-message-scheduling). Not bad!
