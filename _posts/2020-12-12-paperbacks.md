In my last post, I mentioned some books that I came across and skimmed through pages. They were on my reading list, as well.

Recently, for valid reasons, I thought it would be nice to get the hardcopy of some books that I like - even of those which were not in my reading list. Ebooks are getting a little uneasier for my eyes, and I don't have any plans to buy a kindle. Although the amount that has been spent, it feels like adding some more money to purchase kindle might have been a decent choice.

The books that were in the reading list - 

- __Crime and Punishment__ ― *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*
- __The Brothers Karamazov__ ― *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*
- __The Idiot__ ― *Fyodor Dostoyevsky*
- __The Kite Runner__ ― *Khaled Hosseini*
- __The 48 Laws of Power__ ― *Robert Greene*
- __The Castle__ ― *Franz Kafka*
- __War and Peace__ ― *Leo Tolstoy*
- __Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison__ ― *Michel Foucault*

<br>

__Fyodor Dostoyevsky__ is one of my favourite writers, so I kept him on top of the priority list. Even though I've not read his books from page to page, I do have watched countless videos on him and his work, have read hundreds of quotes from this books, and memorized a couple of them. As of now, I bought *The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot, and Crime and Punishment*.

Coming to __Franz Kafka__ - since his books are not heavy, I decided not to buy them. I had already read *Metamorphosis* using my phone, so I'm sticking to ebooks for his works. I genuinely liked *Metamorphosis*, so, in future, I might purchase it to keep it on my table.

> __Update:__ After some back-and-forth, I ordered Metamorphosis. I feel like a hypocrite now.

The next book that I bought is *War and Peace* by __Leo Tolstoy__ after accidentally stumbling upon a video by __TED-Ed__ - [Why Should You Read Tolstoy's War and Peace?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dn7TEjnbPY). To reduce the further risk of boredom, I watched a [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0LthBLZtBk), as well. 


__George Orwell's__ *1984* and *Animal Farm* comes under the section of my favorite books. Being read both of them once, I decided to buy them without any hesitation.

__What's next?__

In 2018, I heard about __Friedrich Nietzsche__, and since then, I've been thinking about reading his books. I did read *Beyond Good and Evil*, but I hardly remember anything. My fresh understanding regarding Nietzsche's philosophy didn't help me to get to know anything beyond his words. In 2019, I read BGE again, but I understood some of it.

This time, with a little bit of familiarity with philosophy and some understanding of Nietzsche’s work, I’m giving myself another chance to read his books. It is one of the reasons I bought *Beyond Good & Evil* and *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*.

Recently, I even started reading *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, but kept it aside as I thought it would be decent to follow the right order to read Nietzsche, which is - 

- The Antichrist
- The Twilight of the Idols
- The Genealogy of Morals
- Beyond Good and Evil
- Thus Spoke Zarathustra
- The Gay Science
- The Dawn of Day
- Humans, All Too Human

Again, I'm skipping *The Antichrist*, *The Twilight of the Idols*, *The Genealogy of Morals* as I'm genuinely interested in reading *Beyond Good and Evil*.


Coming to __Albert Camus__, who is one of my favorite philosophers.

> “Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee? But in the end one needs more courage to live than to kill himself.” <br>
> ― Albert Camus, *A Happy Death*

After reading that quote, I was genuinely surprised. I wanted to understand what the writer has to say. I had no reason to interpret it in my way.

One of the things that I've learned in 2019 is when you read something, keep your interpretation aside for the sake of prevention against the absurd relation with your situations and thoughts with what you're reading. I don't want to go into the details, but I might write about it in the upcoming days as to why I don't relate to what I read. Reading does not mean creating a void for yourself.

In 2019, I was aware of who Camus is, but I never really read any of his books. During the lockdown, after wasting half of the month, I thought it would be nice if I read something, I picked *The Myth of Sisyphus* out of nowhere. Later, I read *The Stranger*, *The Fall*, and *The Plague*.

__Why did I buy The Myth of Sisyphus?__ I genuinely like the book. There's no other reason.

*The Origin of Species* by __Charles Darwin__ is something that I need to read again and again. That's why I purchased it, as well. I'm highly interested in evolutionary biology, and this book lays the foundation of it.  I  don't understand how humans are the product of god's creation. Honestly, it does not make any sense, at all.

I'm not an atheist, theist, or agnostic. I genuinely don't like to put tags or labels on myself. I might write about the reason for it soon.

Coming to *The Interpretation of Dreams* by __Sigmund Freud__. I haven't read much of the pages of this book, but I'm curious about the complexities that dreams carry. If the dreams are meaningful and have something to do with us, sensibly, I need to understand what they bring on the table. One of the reasons I bought this book is that my dreams are absolutely weird. I remember the time when I used to wake up at a specific time, drenched in sweat, no matter when I fell asleep. 

I use an app called "Dream Catcher", where I try to write what I remember from the cinema of sleep.

I haven't read *The Politics* by __Aristotle__, *Prophet* by __Khalil Gibran__ and *Why I'm an Atheist and Other Essays* by __Bhagat Singh__, but I found them interesting. On the other hand, they were not costly, at all, so I didn't have to think much whether I should purchase them or not.

For now, I'm not buying *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison* by __Michel Foucault__, *The Castle* by __Franz Kafka__, *The Kite Runner* by __Khaled Hosseini__, and
*The 48 Laws of Power* by __Robert Greene__
