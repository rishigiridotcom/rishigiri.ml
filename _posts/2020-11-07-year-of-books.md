This year has been great if I look it from reading's perspective. I've not always been curious regarding different topics at the same time, but things were distinctly separate in 2020. It happened probably due to COVID-19 lockdown. I've had time, so I spent a big chunk of my days reading different books.

There are lots of books on this list which I'd like to re-read, or I should say most of them, and I'll probably start going through them slowly, but I'm not sure. I love reading highlights, and I might stick to that.

Life's getting little busier, and that's why I'm writing this blog at the moment as if I won't do it now, I'll probably forget to do it in the future.

One of the things that got little messed is that I didn't care to review or write anything about the books I read. While reading, I did highlight. I read epubs. That's the end.

I'm going to leave this post with the list of books, and hopefully, I'd come back to it so that I can write a couple of sentences for each of them. None of the books on this list is BS, I picked them very carefully, as I had no intention to get bored while reading. As of now, since I'm more or less used to the "reading", from the next year, there won't be any hardcore level of cherry-picking. I'll pick new authors, read new books, read less famous books, review them, and review the old books, too.

Since I had to read everything using my phone or laptop, as of now, I can confidently say that I don't like reading. It's not something that I "enjoy". While I do like the idea of having something read. That's it. I don't have any goals regarding reading. For enjoyment, I'd rather watch a movie, but I don't do that either, so I read books in my free time. I'm not a bibliophile, I don't even know its spelling, I just googled it.

## Part B

On Instagram, I asked for the recommendations, and received tons of [suggestions.](https://rishi.ml/2020/instabooks/), but I found two books interesting.

- __Metamorphosis__ ― *Franz Kafka*
- __Outliers__ ― *Malcolm Gladwell*
- __1984__ *George Orwell*
- __Animal Farm__ *George Orwell*

The last two books were suggested by one of my friends during a conversation. She also introduced me to George Orwell's work. I'm also thankful to my another friend who introduced me to Kafka's work.

__In case you're reading this__ - 

Don't get intimidated by the number of books. The only reason I could read them is due to the lockdown. I had nothing better to do, and that's why I could explore this dimension. I'm not an avid reader, but as I mentioned earlier - I like the idea of having something read. Nothing more, nothing less. This is where it ends.
