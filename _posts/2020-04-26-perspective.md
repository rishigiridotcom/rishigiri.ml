One of the few things that I've witnessed on social media is the urge that people have for conversation, and it makes me wonder why people want to talk 24/7. I'm not even exaggerating. 

In my case, things are a little different, as I went from indulging in conversations to avoiding them. Back in the days (~2016), I could talk to people, and I genuinely enjoyed it. I made lots of friends on social media because of my activeness and interaction. Do I regret doing it? No. Can I still do these things? Of course, not.

In the last two-three years, my mindset has drastically changed about socializing on social media and texting. Don't get me wrong I would love to talk to people once in a while, and I'm a big fan of productive conversations, but the sensible exchange of messages, in my case, it happens rarely.

From a couple of days, I'm feeling odd about my presence on social media. It's one of the reasons why I decided to <a href="../another-break">take a break</a>, and I don't plan using most of the platforms anytime soon.

At this point, my mind is in an absolute weird state, and I'm having problems figuring out the solution. I'm trying to understand what's bothering me more, whether it's people in general, their actions, or their words. 

I'm also thinking, what if I'm blaming people for the problems that can surely be fixed if I adjust my mindset about how I perceive things? I'm trying to understand my issues. I've started to dislike a lot of people. I don't hate them, but I don't want to interact with them either. 

I'm not levitating above anyone, but when someone's action disturbs me even for once, I face problem going back to the phase where I can have neutral feelings about them. This feeling is different from what we call "holding a grudge." It's more about inconvenience and wastage of time. 

How is this different from holding a grudge?

My problem has more to do with perspective. It's not about resentment and has absolutely nothing to do with it. I don't think it's about hate, either, as I've said, I don't hate people. Dislike and hatred are two different terms, and for me, they travel parallel to each other.

To fix my problem, I'm wondering what I can do. I don't want to be that guy who ends up in a phase where he feels negative about everything. I don't want to end up as a cynic. These elements bring a lot of unproductivity on the table, and for me, there's nothing worse than being unproductive.

Since last night, in chunks and pieces, I'm listening to Naval and reading the transcripts of his podcasts. A few hours back, I finished listening to one of his [podcasts with Shane](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/naval-ravikant-on-reading-happiness-systems-for-decision/id990149481?i=1000381983198&mt=2). My main focus was to take notes of the parts where he's talking about building habits. Naval is one of my favourite thinkers, and I did learn a lot from his words. 

It's not that I entirely lack discipline and I don't have a habit, but there's nothing wrong to consume the right thing for the sake of motivation, and for obvious reasons, his words work. 

I'm not planning on building a schedule. My goal is to be more consistent and disciplined with what I do, and it involves ignoring everything that puts even a tiny bit of negative impact on my mind. I'll avoid and ignore people, social media, and all sorts of things that have unconsciously become a part of my life, and are no value to me in any way. Moreover, I even plan on putting a full stop on replying to messages that could lead to unproductive conversations. I have no intention of consuming negativity in any form, and I'll do my best to maintain a proper distance from it. 

Now that I've written everything down here, I feel like my mind is somewhat free from the entanglements, and it has started to breakdown the issues into simpler forms. Currently, this is a temporary fix, but with more discipline and habit, I'll sort these problems out of my way.

__It's 7:28 AM, and I just saw one of Naval's tweet, and I feel relaxed after reading it.__
