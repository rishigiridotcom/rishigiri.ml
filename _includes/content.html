<h2>About Me</h2>

<b> Work in Progress! </b>

<hr>

<p>Hi, I'm Rishi. I move slowly and build things. One of the reasons I like building tools is that they were once just an idea in my head when I was diving deep into the void (getting bored), and it's refreshing to see those ideas taking form.</p>

<p>There is nothing extraordinary about me, but I consider myself to be an enthusiastic learner. I am mostly driven by curiosity, deadlines, and a bit of stress. Sometimes, the factor can also be an unhealthy obsession to see the result or the fear of procrastination.</p>

<p>I have a strong passion for working towards a purpose, and I find immense joy in exploring the vast world of technology. My interests lie in web technologies, computer networking, distributed systems, operating systems, low-level engineering, and open-source software. I'm a big fan of scrapping data and building automation tools.</p>

<p>Beside technology, I have a keen interest in various subjects, including history, philosophy, politics, religion, neuroscience, and psychology. I find it rewarding to explore and gain insights into these topics, as they offer a different perspective on the world around me. I approach these subjects with an open mind and a desire to learn and understand more without any preconceived notions or biases. Although I am not an avid reader or writer, I do make an effort to read or write from time to time. I do, however, have a [blog](/blog) where I share my thoughts and ideas, and I have a wiki (*not public yet*) which captures a good portion of my life.</p>

<p>I admire Aaron Swartz. He's been a great inspiration to me for a long time.</p>
