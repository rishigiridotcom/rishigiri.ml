    <p>I'm <strong>Rishi</strong>, a Computer Science Engineering Student. Technically, I should have been pursuing B.Tech, but I'm not, so, apart from the books, <strong>I rely heavily on the Internet for my studies related to computer science</strong>. I think it's fair to give myself a tag of CSE student. I'll soon graduate without a technical degree.</p>
    
    <p>I love <strong>working for a cause</strong>, and I'm passionate about learning and understanding <strong>Web Technologies, Programming languages, Computer Networking, Distributed Systems, Operating System</strong>, and <strong>Open Source Software</strong>. <strong>I like Computers!</strong></p>

    <p>There is nothing extraordinary about me, but I consider myself an enthusiastic learner. I understand the importance of self-studies, it has taught me a lot, and it's one of the reasons I deeply care about <strong>Quality Education</strong> and the <strong>Indian Education System</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Apart from the tech part, I love exploring topics related to <strong>Social Issues, Philosophy, Politics, Religion</strong>, and of c0ourse, <strong>Psychology</strong>. I'm not a reader or writer, but I try to read or write from time to time. I do have a <a href="/blog">blog.</a> </p>
