                For a while, I've been thinking about getting back to my blog. In the past few months, I wrote a lot but never dared to put anything here. If you ask me why? The answer will be, "I don't know." </p>
            <p>
                I love this place, but I was away from it. I don't know why. Always felt like coming back here soon, but couldn't make it through. Life has so much to deal with that I forgot to do one of the few things I thoroughly love. Strange, right? But I think it happens. Once in a while, we all deal with the deceptive appearance of life, and it makes us forget the simple things we deserve to reminisce.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A little bit about the past year ~</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Genuinely speaking, a large portion of my 2018 was spent travelling, doing Freelance works, and drinking. I'm not an Alcoholic, but 2018 was perfectly spirited, and I don't regret anything about it. I won't call it a great year, but it was fine. Some days were good, some were bad, but we go!
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the year when I fell in love, and learned another aspect of life. I must say, breakups are tough, but there is no reason to be stuck in the same place when you can already predict the consequences of your current action. For better, I tried to keep things as nice as I could. Goodbyes don't have to be hard sometimes. Believe me, when I'm writing this, I'm not sad and neither I'm feeling odd. Anyway, let's talk about some more things.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><b>2018 - The Good Part!</b></i>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lived homeless for 10 days.</li>
                <li>Read ~40+ Books.</li>
                <li>Travelled, a lot!</li>
                <li>Good time with Friends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <i><b>2018 - The Bad Parts!</b></i>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uselessly spent too much of the money.</li>
                <li>On an average, I smoked ~5 cigarettes, daily.</li>
                <li>Multiple accidents and injuries.</li>
                <li>Poor Health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If I look back, I'll call it an average year because there is so much I couldn't do. To be honest, I'm not worried about anything that I wasn't able to complete, but I'm not planning to set a resolution for the sake of fake-motivating myself because I don't want the ongoing year to start with hypothetical plans, and end with annihilation.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"So, what are you planning to do in 2019?"</p>
                <p>A real answer to this question would be, "Good Things!". That's it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Throughout the year, I'll be active here. I believe I've got so much to write, and too much of the BS to share, which I'll do.
            </p>
            <p>
                One more thing ~ I'm not trying to run a blog. The fact is, it's one of the few places where I feel happy, so, by being here, I'm not putting an enormous effort to be away from the frustration caused by other human beings.
