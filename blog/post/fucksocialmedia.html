            <h1>Fuck Social Media</h1>
            
            <p> <code> <small>18th of November, 2017</small> </code></p>

            <p>I'm quitting the social media, for a while, not because I'm depressed or had a heartbreak, which most of the people might assume as one of the reasons for going off from these shit sites. </p>

<p>One of the backlogs from many is that I feel anxious about so many things when I'm on it. I don't know why. The small activities of people make me feel weird from the inside. I don't want to understand these people, but, my habit of paying attention to even the small things ends up making me do which I don't want to. </p>

<p>I won't put morality above everything and say that I don't have any problem with people when the truth is - most of them are cunts. I dislike people, a lot of them. Why? I don't know. It's either their activity or mostly stupidity. </p>

<p>To be honest, I seriously get this feeling that our generation is completely fucked up. Sometimes, I have a hard time understanding people's silly behavior, their fucked up talks, and concepts which are nothing but a deep shithole. I don't get it. The youth is going nuts. The men, women, social justice warriors, feminists, Agenders, genderless, Androgynes, Bigenders, Genderqueers, non-binaries, Gender benders, Pangenders, Queer heterosexuals, Third genders, Trans man, Trans woman, Transmasculine, Transfeminine, Trigenders, and Two-Spirts, almost everyone is fucking up with something. </p>

<p>If this isn't fucked up, then I don't know what else is. The amount of useless complexity that we've brought is fucking up with everything. </p>

<p>On one side, we've got people who are working their asses off, learning things, building something useful, trying to create something that matters, and on the other hand, we've got people who are fucking up with their life on the social media, deleting their Instagram posts, and feeling insecure, because they think, their girlfriend might end up sucking someone else's dick. </p>

<p>Not much fucks do I give to them but, that's so fucked up and bullshit. </p>

<p>I won't lie but, I've lost my enthusiasm when it comes to talking or texting. I don't like it. I pretend that I enjoy talking but, it hardly happens. I'm literally on the edge where all I want to do is avoid conversations, especially, with the people who have got zero sense of humor. </p>

<p>Another thing that's messing up with my mind is the people who are uselessly pretending to be cool on the social media platforms, for no fucking reason. There are a vast majority of people who are just bunch of sensitive pussies, who feel offended by everything. </p>

<p>So, I'd be completely wrong if I don't say that there is nothing wrong with our generation. </p>

<p>I don't know what I can do or, pretend to do about it because most of the time I stay calm and ignore so many things, but sometimes I feel shits are going above the head.</p> 

<p>The only reason I'm taking this break is that I'm done dealing with morons. </p>

<p>I've decided to spend my time reading books, coding, crafting blog posts, and learning things which matters. Till now, things are going well. It feels good and enough to spend your time doing something you actually like. </p>

<p>Sooner or later, I'll be back to these places because of my work. Till then, I'll enjoy my time. </p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
