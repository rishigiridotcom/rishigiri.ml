            <p>The second day in a row and I'm already regretting. This strange feeling making me feel weird from the inside is not because of the alcohol, but I'm not going to lie, I'm not an Alcohol-Person. I don't drink a lot, and I try to be part of this game most with my friends, but sometimes you do things for no reason, and I had one. Sounds a little bit tricky, but is there anything I can pretend to do to make it look simple when the reality is - I have no idea about anything that's happening right now.</p>
            <p>Anyway, let's try to break a few things down to understand what's going inside my mind. I'm ready to pretend that till now whatever I've written is pure philosophy when we all know there is nothing philosophical about it. But what's wrong in pretending? Well, a lot of things. But am I interested in talking about it? Absolutely, no. But the question is - Am I going to talk about it? Well, why the fuck not? I will probably not.</p>
            <p>I met some of my old friends, and we decided to party, but no one likes partying, so, we decided to do what's easy, i.e., have a few drinks and chill out. It was the best option because the other options were worst. Hello?</p>
            <p>The best part of this day is - I don't remember shit, and I don't. I have no idea what's happened because I don't remember shit, because I can't. There were a few pictures on my phone which I saw the other day, and I had no idea what to say about it. The pictures are not weird, but the fact that I have no idea about anything makes me feel furious every time I try to think about it.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the day, everyone was passed out. Life is weird, but not my beard.</p>
            <p>I think it's the first time I've described my day in the shortest and the most sensible possibly possible. How and why? Well, it's because I don't remember shit. Now I think it's getting unfunny and repetitive, just like the mainstream comedians. But was there anything funny about it? I think the answer for it would be another question, which is - Is there anything funny about the mainstream comedians? I'm not a mainstream comedian, so I don't have to be funny, but these mainstream comedians, well, they really need to be.</p>
            <p>Like if the previous day wasn't enough and the night wasn't over, it was time for some fun, and just like another sane man, we decided to buy a bottle of Old Monk. The only mistake I did was that I drank more than I should have. Right now when I'm writing down things here, my head is exploding, but I'm not feeling sleepy, and even if I go to bed, I won't be able to sleep. Thanks to my uncontrollable thoughts.</p>
            <p>After a few hours of the drunk philosophical session, I came home, but thanks to my sanity that I ended up buying another bottle of rum. You should know - this is not who I am, but sometimes, it's what I become, and I'm not proud of it.</p>
            <p>At around 9 pm, I had drunk enough to let the shit pass from my mind to the mouth, but fortunately, there wasn't anyone with me, and it's a good thing. My mind was so bloated with the silly thoughts and extremely senseless jokes, and I used WhatsApp to shit over. I ended up uploading a silly video of on the YouTube. I might have possibly sent those videos to some other people, but I'm not going to check it now. It doesn't make sense, and I don't want to feel weird about what I did.</p>
            <p>In the last two days, I've slept for 4-5 hours, and I have no idea what I can't sleep right now. I've started to dislike more and more people, even those whom I used to like. Life is weird. I'll probably smoke a cigarette, and try to get some rest, because I need it.</p>
            <p>There's a lot of things I wanted to share, but I can't write anymore, and I'm sure when I will wake up, I hardly remember anything. This story has to end in a pathetic way, but let's face it.
