						I love writing code, more than anything or anyone. But the sole reason for writing this is not to express my love towards anything. 
<br><br>
A few days back, I was thinking about my life - since, I decided not to join any college, so things were not really in my favor. But, never in my life, I felt that I can't do something. I live a positive life. I believe in myself. I trust my capabilities.<span class="more"> No, I'm not saying all these things because I'm overconfident related to my decision of staying home and studying everything from the Internet. I'm writing it because I feel and believe that I can do better even if I don't attend any college. And to be honest, several times in the past I've done things which are helping me today to make this decision. Moreover, I don't think colleges are the only factor if you want to be good in something.
<br><br>
I'm not against Colleges or Universities. I'm not against anything. But once in my life, I wanted to do something which I felt will make things right for me, so I decided to stay at home and study all by myself.
<br><br>
So, what is the main reason for writing this post? To be honest, the only reason I'm writing this so that people can stop asking me what I'm doing or how I'm studying things from the Internet. Answering the same thing over and over again is not productive. It kills a lot of time.Another reason is that I'll try to make few points clear related to my studies, which is not really important but I guess, it will help someone who wants to learn things even without going to the College. 
<br><br>
So, this year, most of my friends (all) left this place for higher education, mostly for engineering. 
<br><br>
I feel happy for them. After all, those fuckers are going to be good in Programming and, they'll even have a degree. Which is a plus point for them? I think, yes. But I'm not really sure about it.
<br><br>
When all these things were happening, an idea came to my mind and, it was - "Let's complete some of the online courses in a short period of time." It wasn't a bad thought. So, without wasting my time, I decided to start it but I had no idea from where should I begin. Yes, even after spending so much time writing code, I still get confused when it comes to choosing the right platform because there are too much of them.
<br><br>
Well, I decided to go little down and begin from the Codecademy and complete their each and, every course. I'm not a beginner in Programming, I already know how to code, but I want to do this because why not? It's always good to test how much patience you've in you. And doing something you already know - I think it's quite contradictory to what I said earlier because I'm doing the same thing but the only difference is that I'm not giving it too much time and, I'm doing other things as well. 
<br><br>
In the upcoming 2-3 months, I will try (I'll) finish most of the free online courses because I want to collect the badges and certificates they provide. Finally, I will continue my FCC Journey from where I'll get some really important certificates. 
<br><br>
Another important thing, I'm just not studying one thing. I do multiple of things and I really enjoy them all. Multitasking isn't' a bad thing. 
<br><br>
I'm hoping for the best and working hard for it. Let's see what happens.
